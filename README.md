Swapify lets you swap clothes that you don't want anymore to save money ðŸ’° and help the planet ðŸŒŽ:

1. Add the items you're looking for and the items you can offer to your profile, then simply sit back and wait for a cycle to be found.
2. Once a cycle is found, each user in sequence sends their clothes to the next person, and receives clothes from the previous person.
3. Everyone can feel great in their new clothes and even greater about making an ethical choice!
